# PLEASE NOTE

If you are participating in Project Euler, **please do not** look at the code for problems you have not completed. This repository serves as a location for myself and potential employers to look over my coding abilities.

You will probably find an overwhelming amount of `Python` scripts for early problems, as they're often so simple in terms of complexity that I do not need a compiled language like C++ to perform the tasks in a timely manner.
