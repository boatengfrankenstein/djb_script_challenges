#My /r/dailyprogrammer Solution Hub

[Click here to view the subreddit](https://dailyprogrammer.reddit.com)

Solutions will generally be in Ruby, Scala, Python, or perhaps C++. My solution language will be based on which language I think it'd be easiest to accomplish in. Sometimes I may submit in more than one language if I feel like it (though that will be a very rare occurence).

My number of responses will slow down drastically with the release of my personal project (TimelapsE) and the semester restarting. May attempt some easy ones and shorter intermediate ones occassionally.

Note: This is not meant to be run as a group. Each file contains a specific problem that the program solves independent of every other folder. The problem description is at the top of (most of) the files. 

I don't usually attempt the 'Hard' category problems due to how much time they consume to complete.

###How to run each type

(disclaimer: these may-or-may-not be 100% correct as I'm not at a computer capable of running all 3 of these types when writing this, but they should be if I remembered properly)

#### Ruby
```ruby
cd file_path
rb file_name.rb
```

#### Python
```python
cd file_path
py file_name.py
```

#### Scala
```scala
cd file_path
scala file_name.scala
```
